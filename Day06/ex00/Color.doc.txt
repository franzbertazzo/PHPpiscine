The Color Class handles RGB color values you can pass individual
R,G,B or a positive integer to be instantiated

• The Color Class must have a __toString method. See example output for formatting.

• The Class includes a Boolean static attribute called verbose to control the
displays related to the use of the Class. This attribute is initially False.

• If and only if the static attribute verbose is true, then the Class constructor and
destructor will produce an output.

• The Class haves a static method called doc that returns the documentation of
the class in a string. (in this specific case the documentation does not have to be
long).

• The Class has a method called add that allows you to add the the components
of the current instance to the components of another instance argument. The
resulting color is a new instance.

• The Class has a method called sub that allows you to substract the components of the current instance to the components of another instance argument.
The resulting color is a new instance.

• The Class has a method called mult that allows you to multiply the components of the current instance to the components of of another instance argument.
The resulting color is a new instance.
